This github contains all the code and files used for the ads dataset project with Adriana Kovashka at Pitt. 

Fairface code: code used for facial recognition and analysis

Adjective data code: code used for analysis of json file containing the adjectives and rason statements of the ads

Intership Data excel file: contains imported data from codes and sorted pivot table of data

Intership analysis access file: contains queried data from excel import crated by the code

NOTE: The excel tables are incomplete due to the data processing being incomplete. This is just a baseline. The challangs faced were not being able to process the amount of data/ads within the folders. You will need some type of computer or GPU that is able to process the proper amount of data.
